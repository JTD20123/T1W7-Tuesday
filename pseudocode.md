-plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or a program.
-Bridge between the programs logic and the actual code.

## Importance
-Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so its easier to code.
-Improves collaboratin in team projects
-Helps with troubleshooting
-identify the core areas of the programing that needs to be done.

## Characteristics:
-Plain language: Simple and understandable
-Structured: Follows a proper logic sequence
-Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntax
-Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic Constructs:

- Sequential
---
    step 1: do this
    step 2: do that
---

-Conditional
---
    if condition matches then
        do something
    ELSE
        Do something else
    END IF
---

-Loops
---
    WHILE condition meets
        Do something
    END WHILE
---

---

    FOR EACH item in collection
        DO something
    END FOR

## Practical Examples
-Example 1: Calcualating the sum of a list of numbers
---
    Initialise sum to 0
    For each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR 
    Print sum
